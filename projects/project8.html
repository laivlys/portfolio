        <h1>Environmental Analysis of Mare Favela</h1>
        <h3>Authors: Sylvia Lam, Madeline Morphis, David</h3>
        <p>Mare is a favela in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and we conducted an environmental analysis to identify significant environmental challenges that the citizens of Mare were facing. Using open-sourced data, we conducted raster analysis in ArcGIS Pro to visulize the rainfall and heat distribution across Brazil and more specifically in Mare.</p>

        <p>After conducting an environmental analysis on Mare, our group decided to focus on the lack of green spaces, close proximity to landfills, food insecurity, and air pollution issues that plagued Mare. Our final presentation included findings from anaecdotal stories from citizens of Mare as well as the current efforts there which we presented to two Mare citizens that were currently furthering their studies in Vriginia Tech. They gave greater insights to the transportation issues in Mare due to the physical infrastructure of small and narrow streets that were not well-maintained which limited the transportation options to mainly motorcycles and bicycles. This made it an issue for mail deliveries and for people who wanted to be ubered home but lived deep in Mare could only be dropped off at the periphery of the favela and had to walk into the neighborhood to get home. As such, there are addresses that are not documented properly and issues with transportation that were their main priorities on top of the environmental issues that we raised.</p>
