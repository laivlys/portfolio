        <h1>Transit Insight</h1>
        <h3>Authors: Sylvia Lam, Byron Huang, and Jia Yue Ma</h3>
        <p>We developed Transit Insight, a web platform designed to visualize and promote sustainable commuting options for Penn Medicine employees. In collaboration with Philadelphia-based transportation start-up Jawnt, and utilizing data provided by Penn Medicine, this tool helps administrators assess and improve access to sustainable transit alternatives across clinic locations.</p>

        </div>

        <p>The homepage offers a geographic overview of Penn Medicine's clinic locations, enabling administrators to visualize spatial distribution and better understand transportation accessibility. Our work with Jawnt emphasized analyzing commuter benefit utilization and exploring emerging sustainable modes, such as Park and Ride and Carpooling, using both proprietary and open-source datasets.</p>

        <p>Here is a glimpse of each sustainbale transportation tab:</p>

        <h4>1. Commuter Benefit</h4>

        <div class="image-container">
        <img src="../images/TI_CommuterBenefit.png" alt="Dashboard Commuter">
        </div>

        <p>This dashboard displays commuter benefit uptake by clinic location. A predictive model estimates expected enrollment based on factors such as transit score, driving vs. transit time savings, and availability of public parking within a 10-minute walkshed. This helps identify anomalies and supports tailored recommendations such as promoting carpooling or park and ride where public transit is less viable.</p>

        <h4>2. Park and Ride</h4>

        <div class="image-container">
        <img src="../images/TI_ParknRide.png" alt="Dashboard ParknRide">
        </div>

        <p>This feature maps potential Park and Ride routes between home and clinic locations, with side-by-side comparisons of travel times across three modes: driving, public transit, and Park and Ride.</p>

        <h4>3. Carpool</h4>

        <div class="image-container">
        <img src="../images/TI_Carpool.png" alt="Dashboard Carpool">
        </div>

        <p>The Carpool dashboard identifies clinics with high carpooling potential. Selecting a clinic reveals recommended home areas and detailed data on the number of commuters, commute times, and modal time differences to assess carpooling feasibility.</p>
