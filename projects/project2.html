        <h1>Pothole Detection and Road Classification</h1>
        <h3>Authors: Sylvia Lam</h3>
        <p>This project utilizes AI to detect potholes on roads and to classify the road type based on the images taken to determine the urgency of maintenance of these potholes. With limited budget and resources, roads that are more dangerous due to higher traffic volume and higher speeds of the cars on the roads should be prioritized for pothole maintenance to uphold public safety.</p>

        <p>100 images were sourced from Google Earth Engine and downloaded to be labelled manually using the Labelme application. These labelled images were then used to fine-tune the Mask R-CNN model that was used for pothole detection. An example of a labelled image is as follows:</p>

        <div class="image-container">
        <img src="../images/PotholeLabel.png" alt="Dashboard Screenshot">
        </div>
        
        <p>The model was also trained to classify the road types into three categories: local, collector, and arterial. Arterial roads being the busiest roads where cars were travelling at high speeds, collector roads connecting local to arterial roads, and local roads carrying cars to residential areas at lower speeds and at lower volumes. This frame of reference can be used to prioritze maintenance of busy roads to ensure public safety is upheld as compared to less busy roads. An example of the end product of the pothole detection and road classification tool is displayed below.</p>
