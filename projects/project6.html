        <h3>Authors: Sylvia Lam and Claudia Low</h3>
        <p>This project is a creation of our very own dashboard: NARVEND. This dashboard is intended for use by public health officials in Mesa City, Arizona to identify and highlight areas afflicted with high rates of heroin overdose. With such overdose information succintly portrayed on NARVEND, health officials can strategically place vending machines to dispense free Narcan nasal spray in the most affected areas to help alleviate the overdose crisis. Additionally, the dashboard will have a pop-up function that allows public health officials to track the current availability of narcan sprays in each vending machine to track usage. This can be used as indicators on whether there is demand for narcan spray from these vending machines and to ensure that the vending machines are continually being stocked to serve the needs of areas that need it most.</p>
